  <h1><u>About</u></h1>

		  <p>Hello! <br>
		  <p>I'm Salim Mansour, a student graduating in April 2020 from the <b style="color:#5e2b97">University of
				Toronto</b> with a <b style="color:#5e2b97">Specialist in Software Engineering</b>.<br>
		  <p>I love problem solving and learning new technologies, and I am
				fortunate to have been given the opportunity to demonstrate this at <b style="color:#5e2b97">Geosoft
				Inc.</b> and the <b style="color:#5e2b97">Centre for Addiction and Mental Health</b>.<br>
		  <p>I also have a deep passion for games. My experience with the medium has encouraged
				me to be an executive of the first ever <b style="color:#5e2b97">Game
				Dev Guild</b> at UofT and develop a solo project <b style="color:#5e2b97">Balloonatics</b>.<br>
		  <p>I aim to combine my programming skills, team player mindset, and burning passion
				to be an <b style="color:#5e2b97">indispensable asset to the game industry</b>.<br>
